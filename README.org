#+TITLE: Emacs Plugins
#+AUTHOR: Ioannis Canellos


* Purpose

This repository serves as an aggregator for Emacs plugins that I actively maintain and contribute to. It uses git submodules to organize and manage multiple plugin repositories in a single location, making it easier to:

- Track development across multiple plugins
- Maintain consistent development workflows
- Share common tools and configurations
- Provide a centralized entry point for all plugin projects
